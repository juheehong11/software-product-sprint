            Hi, Hello! 
            I'm currently a rising junior at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
            I'm working as a research intern at the 
            <a href="https://aiis.snu.ac.kr/eng/">
                Artificial Intelligence Institute of Seoul National University (AIIS)
            </a>
            advised by Prof. 
            <a href="https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en/professor/byung-gon-chun">
                Byung-Gon Chun
            </a>
            as well as a research intern at Berkeley's 
            <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/">
                RISELab
            </a>
            supervised by Prof. 
            <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/">
                Aditya Parameswaran
            </a>
            and Nithin Chalapathi. 

            I'm interested in building softwares that bring useful ideas and tools to life.
            (come back to this later and elaborate :) )

            I used to be involved with the mathematics competitions community. I was a winner in South East Asian Mathematics Competition and a few othe regional competitions, 
            and trained younger matheletes in middle and high school. I also was a top contributer to Mathematical Stack Exchange. 
            I like to read, take photos, and travel. 

            If it sounds like we might get along, let me know! :D
